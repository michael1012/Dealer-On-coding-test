This is my Java solution to problem 2. 
My design scheme is having an Item object to represent items in the store and using an ItemList to contain the Items in an organized fashion. 
The input is passed in as arguments to the Receipt_driver class, the first argument being the list of items that have sales tax, and the second argument being the raw input represented in the test cases.
The Receipt_driver class is responsible for reading the arguments and parsing the files into items and adding them to the item list.
The output of the program is simply console output.

My assumptions are as follows. 
The list of taxed items should be easily changed, so I made it so that you can change it outside of the program and simply pass it into the driver. 
The list of taxed items should be all in lower case, each item separated by lines. 
The taxed items in the test cases are "bottle of perfume" and "music cd".

The input will always follow the same format where the amount of the item is the first number and the base price of a single item is the last number on each line. 
The term "Imported" will always be the first word after the amount of the item.
